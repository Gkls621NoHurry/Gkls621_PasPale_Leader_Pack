			<Text>The word "fate" is merely the starting point of an adventure story, and the moment of "opportunity" is what forges an enduring tale. Maya Yamato, after this miraculous baptism, you are still the skill-oriented you, with a magical laugh and an obsession when talking about equipment. This hexagonal land is also a place for you to showcase your skills; feel free to arrange the infrastructure, create order, and make a small world like a line, dwelling peacefully within it.</Text>

			<Text>She initially worked as a technical staff member and support drummer for the agency. As Pastel*Palettes struggled to find a drummer (the one position that couldn't tolerate fake playing), she temporarily filled in for rehearsals; Chisato, with her keen eye, recognized Maya's beauty behind her glasses and decided to make her an official member (she must wear contact lenses during performances).</Text>

			<Text>The condenser microphone was invented in 1925, the electric guitar in 1931, the tape recorder in 1935... These inventions changed the face of recording studios. By the 1970s, when pioneering experimental trends were flourishing, engineers at EMI's Abbey Road Studios were already skilled in various sound processing techniques.</Text>

			<Text>Maya Yamato is skilled at managing recording equipment, and the equipment room is the perfect place to centrally store these devices. Maya is also a studio drummer. When she first met the other members of PasPale, she excitedly discussed voltage with Hina (What about voltage? For recording equipment, it probably covers everything...).</Text>
