			<Text>Humans began observing celestial phenomena very early. The "Shang Shu" records a solar eclipse around 2137 BC, and Babylonian star catalogs summarized the movements of many celestial bodies. Astronomy necessarily started at an amateur level, but amateur astronomy club organizations didn't truly develop until modern times (e.g., the Leeds Astronomical Society founded in 1859). Astronomy clubs are generally not the mainstream popular clubs in schools either.</Text>

			<Text>During high school, Hina Hikawa was the president and long-term sole member of the Hanasakigawa Astronomy Club, leading it (though "leading" isn't quite apt when alone) through the crisis of dissolution. According to Hina, astronomy clubs belong to the "oddball club" category that finds it hard to recruit new members (Takamatsu Tomori: ?); however, the stargazing events she hosted could attract quite a few students.</Text>
