Their popularity quickly soared; their debut single won a New Artist Award, and they set a record with ten consecutive singles selling over a million copies and collectively topping the charts for 64 weeks. At that time, their child fans might have constituted up to 42.5% of their audience.</Text>

Due to lower-than-expected popularity, her agency decided to rebrand her with a "youthful sexuality" route, presenting her as an innocent middle school girl singing songs with provocative and bold lyrics. Although Momoe became hugely popular from then on, becoming the best-selling idol singer of the 70s, the first teenage closing performer on the Kohaku Uta Gassen, and the top-selling photobook model for seven consecutive years, this packaged and enforced experience also sowed the seeds for her early retirement.</Text>

On October 20, 1979, Momoe announced her relationship with Tomokazu Miura, and on March 7 of the following year, she publicly declared her decision to retire from the entertainment industry. On October 5 of that year, she held her final concert at the Nippon Budokan.

Finally, the single "Blue Coral Reef" (Aoi Sangoshō), released in July of that year, became a hit after several twists and turns (though it didn't reach No. 1, it became Seiko Matsuda's signature song), and through this, she shared a performance with Momoe Yamaguchi that was rich in symbolic meaning for the era.</Text>

It is generally believed that Kondō's betrayal of Akina's affection (he was even photographed in intimate magazine pictures with Seiko Matsuda at the time) provoked this action. On December 31 of that year, the two held a press conference: during which Akina showed goodwill, but Kondō flatly denied their romantic relationship, forcing her to end the program in the "posture of a friend." This event became known historically as the "Golden Screen Incident."</Text>
